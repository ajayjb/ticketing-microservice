# 📨 NATS vs NATS Streaming Server (STAN) – Concepts & Subscription Explained

---

## 🔹 What is NATS?

NATS is a **lightweight, high-performance messaging system** designed for **real-time communication** between services. It supports simple **pub/sub**, **request/reply**, and **queue-based load balancing**.

### ✅ Key Features of NATS:

* **Very fast**, minimal latency.
* Supports **Pub/Sub**, **Request/Reply**, and **Queue Groups**.
* **At-most-once delivery** – messages are not stored unless delivered.
* **In-memory** only by default – no persistence.
* Easy to set up and scale.

---

## 🔸 What is NATS Streaming Server (STAN)?

STAN is a **messaging system built on top of NATS** that adds **persistence, durability, and message replay** features. It is **deprecated** and replaced by **JetStream**.

### ✅ Key Features of STAN:

* **At-least-once delivery** – messages are acknowledged.
* **Persistence**: messages can be stored in memory, file, or DB.
* **Replay**: clients can read old messages.
* **Durable subscriptions**: resume from where the client left off.
* **Higher latency** than NATS due to persistence features.

---

## ❌ STAN Is Deprecated

NATS Streaming (STAN) is now **deprecated**. It has been replaced by:

---

## ✅ JetStream (Recommended)

JetStream is the **modern replacement for STAN**, offering built-in support for persistence and streaming **directly inside NATS**.

### 🚀 JetStream Features:

* **Persistence + replay + acknowledgments**.
* **Exactly-once** or **at-least-once** delivery.
* **Retention policies**, **durable streams**, **message replay**.
* More scalable and robust than STAN.

| Feature          | NATS         | NATS Streaming (STAN) | JetStream (Recommended) |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Message Delivery | At-most-once | At-least-once         | At-least / Exactly-once |
| Persistence      | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes                   |
| Replay           | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes                   |
| Latency          | ⚡ Very Low   | 🐃 Higher             | ⚡ Low (optimized)       |
| Complexity       | 🟢 Simple    | 🟧 Moderate           | 🟧 Moderate             |
| Current Status   | ✅ Active     | ❌ Deprecated          | ✅ Active                |

## 🧐 What is a Subscription?

A **subscription** is when a client tells the messaging system:

> "I want to receive messages on a specific topic."

Messages are sent by **publishers**, and received by **subscribers** who have subscribed to the matching **subject** or **topic**.

---

## 📚 Types of Subscriptions

### 1. Basic (Volatile) Subscription – NATS

* Subscribes to messages **only while connected**.
* Misses messages sent when disconnected.
* No persistence.

```js
nc.subscribe("orders.new", (msg) => {
  console.log("Received order:", msg);
});
```

---

### 2. Queue Group Subscription – NATS

* Messages are **load-balanced** among subscribers in the same group.
* Only **one** member gets each message.

---

### 3. Durable Subscription – STAN / JetStream

* **Saves subscription state**.
* Client can **resume** from the last acknowledged message after a disconnect.

---

### 4. Replay Subscription – STAN / JetStream

* Subscriber can request:

  * All past messages
  * Messages from a specific timestamp
  * Last N messages

```js
js.subscribe("events.login", { deliverPolicy: "all" });
```

## 💡 Analogy

| Concept    | Description                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Topic      | Like a **TV channel**                     |
| Subscriber | Like a **viewer** tuning into the channel |
| Replay     | Like **rewatching** a show you missed     |
| Volatile   | Like **live radio** – no going back       |

---

## 🛠 Use Case Examples

| Scenario                              | Recommended Subscription Type    |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Real-time chat                        | Basic (NATS)                     |
| Task queue for workers                | Queue Subscription               |
| Order processing system with recovery | Durable Subscription (JetStream) |
| Audit logs / analytics                | Replay Subscription (JetStream)  |

---

## ✅ Final Advice

* Use **NATS** for **low-latency, real-time messaging** with no durability needs.
* **Avoid STAN** – it is deprecated.
* Use **JetStream** if you need **persistence, message replay, or reliable delivery**.
